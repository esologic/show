description: Block The Wind is a Maine-based art collective. Our goal is to inspire,
  fuel and exhibit creative works in New England. Between our annual festival and
  artist-first online store, we strive to introduce talented creatives, writers and
  musicians to the public. I am a founding contributor, leading every major project
  in the history of the organization. Check out the websites for the [music festival](https://www.blockthewindfestival.com/)
  and [online store](https://www.blockthewind.com/).
