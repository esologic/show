description: Cabinet full of UV LEDs to accelerate curing of 3D prints from SLA resin
  printers.
domain: mixed (hardware, software)
explanation: This project was a task of mine during my internship at [MADE@MassChallenge](https://masschallenge.org/).
  The goal was to speed up the turnaround time for prints coming through the Formlabs
  Form1+ SLA 3D Printer. There are 72 high power UV LEDs to speed up the curing process
  by blasting prints with UV light driven by an Arduino running code that keeps track
  of and displays the cure time. An interesting challenge with this project was making
  something that looked good, was easy to use and simple to the point where it wouldnâ€™t
  need any maintenance. I didn't know it at the time but this project would end up
  living in this shop until it's closure years later and be upgraded several times
  by several different engineers.
