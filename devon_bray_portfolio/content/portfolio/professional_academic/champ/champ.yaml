description: Tree climbing robot.
domain: mixed (hardware, software)
explanation: Observing wildlife, monitoring forest health, conducting research, and
  detecting invasive species and infections are just a few of the crucial tasks that
  currently require humans to climb trees. Putting people into trees is an expensive
  and potentially dangerous task. The CHAMP (Compliant Hook Arboreal Mobility Platform)
  is a tree climbing robot that carries and controls job-specific payloads to improve
  the safety and efficiency of many arboreal tasks. Major Qualifying Project (MPQ,
  an undergraduate senior thesis project) at [WPI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worcester_Polytechnic_Institute).
