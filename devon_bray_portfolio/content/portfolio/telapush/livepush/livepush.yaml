description: Persistent light installation livestreamed via Periscope.
domain: mixed (hardware, software)
explanation: >-
  This persistent installation was live for around two months. This was used as a
  live demo to potential clients. It was also a way for us to do long term testing
  of software
  and hardware components in a realistic scenario. Common twitter hashtags like #boston,
  #hardware, #startup were integrated to have a constant source of input for animations.
