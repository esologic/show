description: Persistent installation livestreamed via Periscope.
domain: mixed (hardware, software)
explanation: >-
  This persistent installation was live for around two months. This was used as a
  live demo to potential clients. It was also a way for us to do long term testing
  of software
  and hardware components in a realistic scenario. Common twitter hashtags like [#boston](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23boston&src=typed_query&f=top),
  [#hardware](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23hardware&src=typed_query&f=top), [#startup](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23startup&src=typed_query&f=top)
  were integrated to have a constant source of input for animations. This piece lead
  to our first commercial installation with BNT.
