description: Portable installation that followed the Boston New Technology meetup
  group for six months.
domain: mixed (hardware, software)
explanation: >-
  Our first commercial installation, this project was unique in that it had to be
  portable to be
  able to travel from meetup location to meetup location. The software was updated
  per event
  to map to common hashtags used by presenting companies, as well as animate in patterns
  representative of attending companies or sponsors. Each event also had a specific
  hashtag ([#BNT89](https://twitter.com/search?q=BNT89&src=typed_query), [#BNT90](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23BNT90&src=typed_query&f=top)
  etc.) that was also included in the animation table.
  We had to integrate a portable modem to be able to maintain a connection to 4G internet
  as meetup locations wifi wasn't always reliable.
  The the illuminated element on the sign was a recreation of the BNT logo. We also
  created a smaller prompting sign to indicate
  to attendees how to interact with the piece.
