description: Converts footsteps into frame-by-frame video output.
domain: mixed (hardware, software)
explanation: Client needed a solution that could detect footsteps on a treadmill,
  then transmit detections to a host PC. Each time a footstep is detected, a video
  being broadcast via [OBS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OBS_Studio) is incremented
  by a frame. Designed an Arduino based footfall detection algorithm centered around
  an accelerometer. Wrote a python application using openCV to handle creating output
  frames. PC-side application also had to be able to change videos based on input
  from twitch chat. Hardware UI was designed for flexibility. Knobs control different
  parameters of the detection algorithm, button indicates a footstep has been detected
  and can be used to manually increment frame of video. This project is one of a series
  of jobs I've completed for interdisciplinary sculpture artist, [Sara Dittrich](https://www.saradittrich.com/About).
