description: Converts footsteps into frame-by-frame video output.
domain: mixed (hardware, software)
explanation: Client wanted a solution that would detect foosteps on a treadmill, then
  transmit detections to a host PC running OBS for broadcast. Each time a footstep
  was detected, a video would be incremented. I designed the footstep detection algorithm
  using an accellerometer, the hardware to transmit detections over UART was based
  on Arduino. Wrote a python application using openCV to handle creating output frames.
  Application also had to be able to change videos based on input from twitch chat.
  Hardware ui was designed for flexibility. Knobs control different parameters of
  the control algorithm, button indicates a footstep has been detected and can be
  used to manually increment frame of video. This project is one of a series of jobs
  I've completed for interdisciplinary sculpture artist, [Sara Dittrich](https://www.saradittrich.com/About).
