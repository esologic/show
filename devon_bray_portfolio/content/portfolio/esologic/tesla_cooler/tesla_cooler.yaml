description: High performance GPU cooler for the NVIDIA Tesla K80.
domain: mixed (hardware, software)
explanation: Rendered desperate for VRAM by a stylegan-related project, I had to wade
  thermistor first into the concernedly hot and strange world of GPUs without video
  outputs to design a high performance cooler for the NVIDIA Tesla K80. The GPU is
  designed to be installed in server chassis that have a fan pressure delta, where
  cooled air is moved from the front of the case, through the cards and then out the
  back. I wanted to be able to use the GPUs in a regular 4U server chassis or standard
  PC tower so needed to create a cooler. The design is based around off the shelf
  parts and can be printed without supports. Electronics are centered around a Raspberry
  Pi Pico running MicroPython. This entire project was designed and manufactured live
  on stream in the spirit of a hackathon.
