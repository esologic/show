description: Plant growth automation system based on Raspberry Pi.
domain: mixed (hardware, software)
explanation: During the summer break before heading off to college, I wrote a collection
  of scripts to run on the newly released Raspberry Pi to automate the watering schedule
  of some tomato plants. This project ballooned in scope, a twitter integration was
  added to post temperature and soil moisture visualizations automatically. Encouraged
  by the positive feedback given to the development log, I applied for grant funding
  through the Kurt Geisller Foundation for Youth  Achivement. Grant in hand, research
  continued alongside my undergraduate responsibilities at WPI. The grant also demonstrated
  my bona fides to a Professor of mine who graciously allowed me to set up shop in
  the corner of his basement lab in the Physics department. It was there where PiPlanter
  2 was born, a mother/daughter confguration that used the Pi for high level work
  and an Arduino for interfacing with the sensors and controlling lights/pumps etc.
  This second version also saw the integration of a timelapse camera and rudmentary
  computer vision to gauge plant health. There are still echos of this project in
  the work I do today, this was one of my first experiences walking along the edge
  between of hardware and software.
