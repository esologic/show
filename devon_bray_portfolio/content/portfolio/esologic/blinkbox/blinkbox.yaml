description: Test instrument for addressable LEDs.
domain: mixed (hardware, software)
explanation: The humble addressable LED has worked its way into nearly every hardware
  project that has passed through my hands over the years, and is one of the foundational
  technologies that enables Telapush. I needed a simple, flexible and robust way to
  debug these devices during development and created blinkbox to do just that. Something
  with the form of a piece of "benchtop" equipment like an oscilloscope or multimeter
  but could also be carried in a toolbox if need be. A hardware UI enables user to
  select the type and LED count, and a mode button changes the color pattern displayed
  on the LEDs. The large input elements provide satisfying manual feedback.
