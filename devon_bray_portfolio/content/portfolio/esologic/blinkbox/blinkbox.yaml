description: Test instrument for addressable LED development.
domain: mixed (hardware, software)
explanation: The addressable LED has worked it's way into nearly every hardware project
  I've worked on over the years, and one of the foundational technologies that enabled
  Telapush. I needed a simple, durable and robust way to debug these devices during
  development and created blinkbox to do just that. I wanted something with the form
  of a piece of "benchtop" equipment like an oscilloscope or multimeter but could
  also be carried in a toolbox if need be. A hardware UI enables user to select the
  type and LED count, and a mode button changes the color patter displayed on the
  LEDs.
