description: Sketch to be able to measure multiple periodic squarewaves using an Arduino.
domain: mixed (hardware, software)
explanation: This simple project was completed very quickly and has served me well over the years. It is a simple Arduino sketch that uses interrupts to measure the frequencies of singals coming in on digital pins. I've recylced this code many times over the years to great effect.
