description: Sketch to be able to measure multiple periodic squarewaves using an Arduino.
domain: mixed (hardware, software)
explanation: This simple project was completed very quickly and has served me well
  over the years. A simple Arduino sketch that uses interrupts to measure the frequencies
  of signals coming in on digital pins. This code has been recycled a number of times
  and is a great example of the strengths of timer programming typically found on
  embedded devices.
