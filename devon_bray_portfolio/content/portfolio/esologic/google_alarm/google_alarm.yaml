description: Uses Google calendar to trigger music playback on a set of speakers via
  a Raspberry Pi.
domain: software
explanation: An ancient project, one of the very first published on the blog. Used
  the freshly released Raspberry Pi to prevent my highschool self from sleeping in.
  This post was featured on lifehacker.com, a major technology publication. The thrilling
  rush of comments, and feedback that resulted from this post is probably what lead
  to me continuing to publish my work in this way for so long. Little did I know at
  the time, but both the Raspberry Pi and Python would remain a major part of my life
  for years to come. It's probably inappropriate to include such an old project
  in a portfolio like this but this work will always have a place in my heart, and
  is the earliest example of my affinity for mixing disperate inputs and outputs.
