description: Uses Google calendar to trigger music playback on a set of speakers via
  a Raspberry Pi.
domain: software
explanation: An ancient project, one of the very first published on the blog. Used
  the freshly released [Raspberry Pi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raspberry_Pi)
  to prevent my high school self from sleeping in. This post was featured on lifehacker.com,
  a major technology publication. The thrilling rush of comments, feedback that resulted
  from this post is probably what lead to me continuing to publish my work in this
  way for so long. Little did I know at the time, but both the Raspberry Pi and Python
  would remain a major part of my life for years to come. It's probably inappropriate
  to include such an old project in a portfolio like this but this work will always
  have a place in my heart, and is the earliest example of my affinity for mixing
  disparate inputs and outputs.
