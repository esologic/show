description: Twitter-enabled window.
domain: mixed (hardware, software)
explanation: A strand of LEDs hung in my street-facing college dorm room could color
  based on input from a public twitter account. Accepted text or images as input.
  After the color change was completed, an image of the result was replied back to
  user. This concept eventually grew to become [Telapush](https://telapush.com/).
  A preeminent experience of mine in the thrilling medium of public installation art.
