description: Tool to map music and video into the latent space of StyleGAN2 networks.
domain: software
explanation: In collaboration with [Won Pound](https://wonpound.bandcamp.com/) for
  his forthcoming album release via [minaret records](https://minaretrecords.bandcamp.com/artists)
  I was recently commissioned to lead an expedition into [latent space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_space),
  encountering intelligences of my own haphazard creation. Created the camera used
  to capture training images, then trained [StyleGAN2](https://github.com/NVlabs/stylegan2)
  networks. Experimentation lead to new methods to input music and video into the
  networks. Note that this tool is an active work in progress.
