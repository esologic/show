description: Personal engineering [blog](https://www.esologic.com). Catalogs the development
  of open-source projects, serving as the publication outlet for their releases alongside
  occasional tutorials and teardowns. My goal is to share useful engineering techniques
  and methods, promoting the open exchange of ideas. There's an accompanying YouTube
  channel [here](https://www.youtube.com/user/esological). The following is a representative
  selection of works published over the 10+ year history of the site.
