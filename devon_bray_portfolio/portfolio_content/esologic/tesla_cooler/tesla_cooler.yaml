description: High performance GPU cooler for the NVIDIA Tesla K80.
domain: mixed (hardware, software)
explanation: Rendered desperate for VRAM by a [StyleGAN-related](https://www.esologic.com/gance/)
  project, I had to wade thermistor-first into the concernedly hot and strange world
  of GPUs without video outputs to design a high performance cooler for the NVIDIA
  Tesla K80. The GPU is designed to be installed in server chassis that have a fan
  pressure delta, where cooled air is moved from the front of the case, through the
  cards and then out the back. I wanted to be able to use the GPUs in a regular 4U
  server chassis or standard PC tower so needed to create a cooler. The design is
  based around off the shelf parts and can be printed without supports. Electronics
  are centered around a [Raspberry Pi Pico](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-pico/)
  running [MicroPython](https://micropython.org/). This entire project was designed
  and manufactured live on stream in the spirit of a hackathon.
