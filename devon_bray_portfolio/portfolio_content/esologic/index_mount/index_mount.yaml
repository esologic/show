description: Over-engineered rack mount for the Valve Index.
domain: hardware
explanation: Needed a way to house this [VR headset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valve_Index)
  in an already overcrowded space, ended up designing a geometrically interesting
  series of print-friendly models based on the [open-source models](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/IndexHardware)
  of the headset published by Valve. This project ended up gaining some popularity,
  having several remixes published on thingiverse. The modeling was a rewarding challenge.
