description: Test instrument for addressable LEDs.
domain: mixed (hardware, software)
explanation: The humble [addressable LED](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LED_strip_light)
  has worked it's way into nearly every hardware project that has passed through my
  hands over the years, and is one of the foundational technologies that enables [Telapush](https://telapush.com/).
  I needed a simple, flexible and robust way to debug these devices during development
  and created blinkbox to do just that. Something with the form of a piece of "benchtop"
  equipment like an [oscilloscope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscilloscope) or
  multimeter but could also be carried in a toolbox if need be. A hardware UI enables
  user to select the type and LED count, and a mode button changes the color pattern
  displayed on the LEDs. The large input elements provide satisfying manual feedback.
