description: Over the years I've published a number of standalone 3D printable designs.
  This entry aggregates the most useful and most interesting.
domain: hardware
explanation: 3D Printing is a favorite technology and it is leveraged heavily in my
  work, professional and otherwise. For mechanical CAD, my go-to software suite is
  [Solidworks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SolidWorks) but occasionally I've utilized
  [Fusion 360](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autodesk) or [ZBrush](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZBrush).
  In my studio I use a [Prusa i3 Mk2s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prusa_i3), but
  have worked intimately with [Formlabs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formlabs),
  [Stratasys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratasys) and [LulzBot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleph_Objects)
  machines as well. Typically my designs are utilitarian in nature.
