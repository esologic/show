description: Plant growth automation system based on Raspberry Pi.
domain: mixed (hardware, software)
explanation: During the summer break before heading off to college, I wrote a collection
  of scripts to run on the newly released [Raspberry Pi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raspberry_Pi)
  to automate the watering schedule of some tomato plants. This project ballooned
  in scope, a twitter integration was added to post temperature and soil moisture
  visualizations automatically. Encouraged by the positive feedback given to the development
  log, I applied for grant funding through the [Kurt Geissler Foundation](https://kurtgiessler.com/index.html).
  Grant in hand, research continued alongside my undergraduate responsibilities at
  WPI. The grant also demonstrated my bona fides to a Professor of mine who graciously
  allowed me to set up shop in the corner of his basement lab in the Physics department.
  It was there where PiPlanter2 was born, a mother/daughter configuration that used
  the Pi for high level work and an Arduino for interfacing with the sensors and controlling
  lights/pumps etc.
