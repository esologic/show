description: Sketch to be able to measure multiple periodic squarewaves using an Arduino.
domain: mixed (hardware, software)
explanation: Arduino implementation of a [frequency counter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency_counter).
  This simple project was completed very quickly and has served me well over the years.
  A simple Arduino sketch that uses interrupts to measure the frequencies of signals
  coming in on digital pins. This code has been recycled a [number of times](https://www.esologic.com/hitchco-mk4/)
  and is a great example of the strengths of timer programming typically found on
  embedded devices.
