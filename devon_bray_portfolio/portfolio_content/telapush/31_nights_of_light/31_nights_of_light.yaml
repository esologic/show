description: Month-long installation at the Prudential Center mall in Boston, MA.
domain: mixed (hardware, software)
explanation: >-
  Commercial installation for [Boston Properties](https://www.bxp.com/) to amplify
  their [#31NightsOfLight](https://twitter.com/search?q=%2331NightsofLight) campaign.
  Each night
  in December, the lights on the roof of the Prudential Center would change to a different
  color, raising awareness for a corresponding group or non-profit organization. Ceremonially,
  representatives from the group being showcased would flip a massive light switch
  in the center of the mall as a photo-op.
  Our installation was an illuminated sign attached to the top of
  this light switch
  that would animate when the organizations were mentioned, or corresponding hashtags
  used on social
  media. The piece had to be operating 24/7 unattended and could not use local network
  to connect to
  the internet.
