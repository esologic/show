description: Block The Wind is a Maine-based art collective. Our goal is to inspire,
  fuel and exhibit creative works in New England. Between our annual festival and
  artist-first online store, we strive to introduce talented creatives, writers and
  musicians to the public. I am a founding contributor, leading every major project
  in the history of the organization. Check out the websites for the [music festival](https://www.blockthewindfestival.com/)
  and [online store](https://block-the-wind-store.myshopify.com/). Both the [store](https://www.instagram.com/blockthewindstore/)
  and [festival](https://www.instagram.com/blockthewindfestival/) are on Instagram
  as well.
