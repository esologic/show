description: n-Channel Audio Driver for Sound Sculpture.
domain: mixed (hardware, software)
explanation: Client needed a way to have looping audio play sequentially/simultaneously
  on 8 different speakers housed in a sculpture. Had the additional requirement that
  audio needed to be changed over time and couldn't be "hardcoded", would need to
  be replaced by a non-technical gallery attendant. Total turnaround time for this
  project was under three weeks, and is one of a series of jobs I've completed for
  interdisciplinary sculpture artist, [Sara Dittrich](https://www.saradittrich.com/About).
