description: Reads heartbeat sensor to create perfect water droplets in total silence.
domain: mixed (hardware, software)
explanation: Client needed a device to reliably produce droplets of water for a piece
  of performance art. Because the piece was to be performed in a gallery setting,
  little to no acoustic noise was permissible during operation, ruling out conventional
  DC motor pumps and solenoids. Solution was a stepper motor fitted to a [peristaltic
  pump](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peristaltic_pump) using motor drivers designed
  for making 3D printers operate quietly. Fabricated PCB to package electronics, wrote
  firmware to read heartbeat sensor and drive motors, and did mechanical design and
  manufacturing to produce the monolithic finished actuators. This project is one
  of a series of jobs I've completed for interdisciplinary sculpture artist, [Sara
  Dittrich](https://www.saradittrich.com/About).
